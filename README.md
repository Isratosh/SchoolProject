This code does not compile on Greenfoot 2.4.2 that the school uses. To run this program, download the executable LinkProject.jar and play that. Once the program is running, press the RUN button and hit the space bar to begin. Press E to talk to the Old Man, and then E again to pick up the sword. F to attack the enemies. If the program stops inexplicably in between levels, simply click the RUN button and continue playing.
