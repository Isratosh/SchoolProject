I learned more about Java as I was coding this, so half of it is really shitty and the other half is only sort of shitty. Especially with the "theLink" var I had going. I'll clean that up.

To use this, download greenfoot and just throw this in a project file. Run it. Done.

As of right now, I don`t have the proper images setup. The images are all placeholder bananas and muffins and such. It'll be fixed soon.
